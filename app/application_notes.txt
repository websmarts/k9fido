#The unique index should be removed from clients.myob_client_id 

#Delete client records where clients.name ='' - there is around four.

#Add timestamp columns to the following tables:
 - clients
 - system_orders

 All above are done 30-08-2016

 TRIMMING LIVE DBS

 DELETE FROM system_order_items WHERE CONVERT(SUBSTR(order_id,4,10),UNSIGNED INTEGER) < 24134
 DELETE FROM system_orders WHERE id < 24134

 DELETE FROM clientstock where id < 556951

 DELETE FROM contact_history where id < 26536

 ADD a system_order_id colum to system_order_items table and then:
 UPDATE system_order_items set system_order_id = CONVERT(SUBSTR(order_id,4,10),UNSIGNED INTEGER)
